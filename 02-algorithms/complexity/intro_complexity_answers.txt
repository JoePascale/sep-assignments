1. Speed-wise, an algorithm that has O(1) efficiency is a Ferrari whereas an
algorithm that has an efficiency of O(2^n) is a Prius.

2. The best-case scenario for binary search would be O(1) or constant time,
but it would take some great guessing to accomplish.

3. The worst-case scenario for binary search would be O(log n) or
logarithmic time, which is still relatively quick.

4. The average-case scenario for binary search would also be O(log n),
since the nature of the search is still based on halving the data set at
each iteration.
