1. If we were looking for the value G in the given data set, it would take 7
searches (or loops) to find the actual value when using linear search.

2. If we were looking for the value G via binary search, it would only take 2
searches to identify it's location in the data set.

3. fib(10) = 55; fib (11) = 89; fib(12) = 144
