I struggled a bit with the pop method in this assignment, but ultimately
figured out that I need to simplify my code.  I originally was focused on the
pseudo code in the checkpoint & tried to implement the array edits based on
the index of the item, but realized I really didn't need to worry about that.
I rather just created a substring for the stack instance each time the pop method
was called & it ended up being a fine solution.
