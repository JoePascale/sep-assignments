1. For the screen assignment, I focused on implementing many declarations of
self to make accessing any individual attributes easy for others.
2. Specific elements would be easy to find due to the above.  It is mostly tied
to methods that can be called because of my initializers that contain references
to self.
3. A great example that the screen app could translate to would be a chess board.
