1.  Spacial locality is when you access data elements that are relatively
close to each other in memory.  It benefits performance because retrieving
elements that are close to each other requires less time, & hence provides
faster access with less effort on the part of the computer.
2. I didn't implement very thorough ways of comparing array vs. linked list
benchmarks, but I did at least manage to create some data to compare. Results
are as follows:

          user     system      total        real
array:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000041)
linked list:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000007)

                user     system      total        real
check array:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000010)
check linked list:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000528)

                      user     system      total        real
remove from array:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000428)
remove from linked list:  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.003842)


It seems that arrays are significantly faster in accessing &
deleting data when it's a very specific element, but not when initializing the
creation of the data set.  When the search or creation is more linear,
linked lists seem to shine well.
